# CoD Zombies Multiplayer Prototype Scene

## Tutorial

  **Multiplayer:**  
    - When all players are present in the scene, the host can start the game.  
    - You cannot join an existing game.

  **Solo Play:**  
    - Enter the scene normally or by creating a server first.  
    - If you are not hosting the server, you might encounter some H3MP errors. They can be ignored.

**Reviving Players:**  
Hold the grip button on the revive icon.

**Known Issues:**  
Friendly fire is enabled. Do NOT change IFF  
Custom guns don't work for me when playing with others, so I made Wonder weapons optional
